        <h2>Tata Strive Way</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">

            Based on learnings from the Skill Development sector and the specific challenges and gaps that existed, Tata STRIVE developed an ‘onboarding- training-placement’ model, crafting an experience called the ‘Tata STRIVE Way’ to address challenges and equip youth for the end goal of employment or entrepreneurship. The Tata STRIVE way has 3 levers – pedagogy relevant to our target group, defined methodology for each step of the skilling value chain, and technology providing replicability, scalability and measurability. We built to deliver on the quality and scale expected from the house of Tata. And the impact is visible - our mission of impacting 1 Million by 2022 was achieved in March 2022. In Tata STRIVE centres, we are clearly reaching our intended target groups – SC/ST/OBC/Women, with clear outcomes of placement that are well above industry average.

                    Tata's orientation towards building a skilled nation and community is rooted in its culture and history, founded by Shri Jamsetji Tata a century ago. As a company, we have built on his legacy, to contribute in nation-building through skill-building of local communities where we operate.

                    Tata Community Initiatives Trust (TCIT) established Tata STRIVE with a mission to upskill the young workforce and enhance their employability to contribute to India's economic development. We leveraged the combined strength of Tata Group companies and industry partnerships to deploy relevant certified training to the youth and create sustainable livelihoods.
